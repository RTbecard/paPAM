### paPAM
paPAM is an acoustic particle motion analysis program for fish researchers.
- For more information on how and why to analyse particle motion, you can read [the paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292677434_Particle_motion_The_missing_link_in_underwater_acoustic_ecology) which paPAM was initially published in.
- For information on how to use paPAM, please check the [user manual](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RTbecard/paPAM/master/User%20Manual/User%20Manual.pdf).

If you happen to find any bugs in paPAM, please report them [here](https://github.com/RTbecard/paPAM/issues).  Pull requests and geenral suggestions for improving paPAM are also welcome!

### Compiled binaries

If you want to use paPAM but do not have a version of Matlab installed, you can download the following packages to run paPAM as a standalone compiled program.  In fact, we reccomend using the compiled program rather than the matlab scripts, as this avoids any issues which are related to running Matlab scripts which were created on a different version.  Please check the user manual for instructions on how to download and install Matlab Compiler Runtime, a free program which is necessary to run the compiled versions of paPAM.
